Portfolio Overview:

This portfolio is my first fully hand-coded website, built to demonstrate a solid foundation in front-end web development, visual design, and problem-solving. The site was created from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with an emphasis on clean structure, intentional spacing, and responsive design.

Design & Responsiveness:

The layout was designed with readability and visual hierarchy in mind, using consistent spacing and a defined color theme to maintain contrast and cohesion. The site is fully responsive, adapting to desktop and mobile screens through flexible layouts and media queries. A hamburger navigation menu was implemented for mobile devices to ensure usability on smaller screens.

Front-End Development & Interactivity:

JavaScript is used to handle navigation logic, image overlays, and interactive elements throughout the site. All functionality is built with vanilla JavaScript to demonstrate core DOM manipulation and front-end logic without relying on frameworks.
Several sections highlight small problem-solving programs and interactive features, reflecting my ability to break down requirements, write structured code, and debug issues as they arise.

Visual Design & Media Editing:

Visual assets used throughout the site were created and edited in Adobe Photoshop, including image preparation and overlay elements. This project demonstrates my ability to integrate visual design with front-end development to produce a cohesive user experience.

Redesign & Analysis:

One featured project involves rebuilding and modernizing an existing website. This included analyzing the original layout and branding, redesigning the logo, and improving the overall presentation to create a more contemporary and user-friendly interface.

Education & Continued Learning:

The contact page includes a scrolling slider showcasing additional courses completed outside of college, alongside my primary web design certificate earned through my degree program. I study and practice daily, with a strong focus on debugging, problem-solving, and continuous improvement.
